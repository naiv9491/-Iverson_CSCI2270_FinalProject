Project Summary: 

We have created a travel advisor for those interested in exploring the world and its many wonders.

This advising system asks for the user's preference of environment (for example nature, good food, and historical significance) and matches the uer's preference to a database of locations and environmental rankings already stored. Then our program provides the user with a list of the top locations they should visit.

Our program also has the capability of allowing the user to add or delete locations. Initially, we store all locations and their rankings within a text file that the user must download to run the program. From there, the program will read all locations into a linked list. When the user wishes to add a location, we ask for how they would rank each component of the environment and the program stores the information within the linked list of locations.

Finally, our program also provides an option to clalculate the most effecient path that the user could use to see all of their top locations. This efficiency is based from cost of travel and distance factors.


How to Run:
To run, simply download the locations.txt file that contains the places to visit and the .h, .cpp, and main files. Like with all recent homework assignments call the project with "Name of project you save it as" "locations.txt".

PROJECT DOCUMENTATION LINK HERE: 
You should also include a link here to the project documentation that you will provide in
a separate file.


Dependencies: 
The only external component to this program is the locations.txt file which you can download and call when you call the project.


System Requirements 
There are no additional systemm requirements to run this code.
