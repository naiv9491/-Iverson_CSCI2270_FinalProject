Project Summary: 

We have created a travel advisor for those interested in exploring the world and its many wonders.

This advising system asks for the user's preference of environment (for example: nature, food, and historical significance) and matches the uer's preference to a database of locations and environmental rankings already stored. Then our program provides the user with a list of the top locations they should visit.

Our program also has the capability of allowing the user to add or delete locations. Initially, we store all locations and their rankings within a text file that the user must download to run the program. From there, the program will read all locations into a linked list. When the user wishes to add a location, we ask for how they would rank each component of the environment and the program stores the information within the linked list of locations. If the user wishes to delete a location, the program will simply ask for the name of the location to delete.

We also have included smaller functions such as reversing the linked list of locations and displaying the locations for the user's convenience.

Lastly, our program provides an option to sort the locations in order of preference via quick sort or insertion sort. 


How to Run:
To run, simply download the locations.txt file that contains the places to visit and the .h, .cpp, and main files. Like with all recent homework assignments, call the project in the terminal with "Name of project you save it as" "locations.txt".
